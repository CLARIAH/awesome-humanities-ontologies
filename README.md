> A curated list of ontologies for Digital Humanities

*What is an [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list?*

This list collects useful ontologies, vocabularies, terminologies, and taxonomies for modelling and publishing datasets from Humanities domains as [Linked Data](http://linkeddatabook.com/editions/1.0/).
