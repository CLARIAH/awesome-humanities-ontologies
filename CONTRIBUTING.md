Thank you very much for your interest in contributing to this awesome list. This file describes some rules of thumb on how to do it.

## Pull requests

To submit a changed version of the list with your own additions, we suggest you:

- Fork this repository in your own workspace
- Commit/push your changes in that fork
- Submit a pull request to the `master` branch of [this repository](https://github.com/albertmeronyo/awesome-humanities-ontologies)

There's no need to install a git client and you can do all this using the GitHub web interface.

## Headings

Edit [README.md](README.md) to add your contributions to the list of ontologies. When doing so:

- Please follow the logic of the headings
- Try to avoid using the `General` category
- If you add a new category (you're encouraged to do so!), please add a pointer to it in the table of contents

## List element format

To list an ontology, first add a link to it, then a hyphen (-), and then a minimal, one-sentence description of the ontology. Please have a look at existing entries for examples.

## List yourself as contributor

When you are done, please edit [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) and append your name and affiliation at your own discretion
